Difference between Benign and Malignant Tumor?

Benign Tumor                                                                             
1. Non-Cancerous.                                                                         
2. Capsulated.

5. Do not metastasize(spread to the others parts of the body).                            
6. Cells are normal.

 Malignant Tumor:-
 1. Cancerous.
 2. Non-Capsulated.
